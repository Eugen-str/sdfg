## how to run

the game depends only on raylib, so you need to have that installed. I think it's written in raylib 5.0 but 4.x probably works too...

to run on linux:
``make && ./build/sdfg``


to run on windows:
idk figure it out on your own (i'll do it in the future)

W - jump
A - left
D - right

R - reset player position
